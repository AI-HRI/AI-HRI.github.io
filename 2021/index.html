	<p>Submission date is now July 30.</p>

<p id="home">


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Symposium has been a successful venue of discussion and collaboration since 2014. During that time, these symposia provided a fertile ground for numerous collaborations and pioneered many discussions revolving trust in HRI, XAI for HRI, service robots, interactive learning, and more. This year, we aim to review the achievements of the AI-HRI community in the last decade, identify the challenges facing ahead, and welcome new researchers who wish to take part in this growing community.</p>
<p>
Taking this wide perspective, this year there will be no single theme to lead the symposium and <b>we encourage AI-HRI submissions from across disciplines and research interests.</b>
Moreover, with the rising interest in AR and VR as part of an interaction and following the difficulties in running physical experiments during the pandemic, this year we specifically encourage researchers to submit works that do not include a physical robot in their evaluation, but promote HRI research in general. In addition, acknowledging that ethics is an inherent part of the human-robot interaction, we encourage submissions of works on ethics for HRI.</p><p>
Over the course of the two-day meeting, we will host a collaborative
 forum for discussion of current efforts in AI-HRI, with additional talks focused on the topics of ethics in HRI and ubiquitous HRI.
</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ubiquitous HRI, including AR and VR
<li>Ethics in HRI
<li>Trust and Explainability in HRI
<li>Architectures and systems supporting autonomous HRI
<li>Interactive task learning
<li>Interactive dialog systems and natural language
<li>Field studies, experimental, and empirical HRI
<li>Tools for autonomous HRI
<li>Robot planning and decision-making
<li>AI for social robots
<li>Fielding and deployment, and experimentation for autonomous robots
<li>Knowledge representation and reasoning to support HRI and robot tasking
</ul>


<!--<h2>Format</h2>

<p>
In addition to oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, the
symposium will include panel discussions, position talks, keynote
presentations, and a hack session with ample time for networking.
</p>

<p><b>SPEAKERS</b>:
Keynote talks will give different perspectives on AI-HRI and showcase recent advances towards humans interacting with robots on everyday tasks. Moderated discussions and debates will allow participants to engage in collaborative public discussion on controversial topics and issues of interest to the AI-HRI community.</p>

<p><b>NETWORKING</b>:
A large part of this effort is to bring together a community of researchers, strengthen old connections, and build new ones. Ample time will be provided for networking and informal discussions.</p>-->


<h2>Presentation and Publication</h2>

<p>
All accepted full and short papers will be presented orally and published in the proceedings through <a href=https://arxiv.org/>arXiv</a>.
Authors will be notified as to whether they have been assigned a “full-length” or “lightning” presentation slot.

  <li> <a href="https://interactive.mit.edu/about/people/julie">Julie Shah</a> <br>
  <font size=2>Julie Shah is an Associate Professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and leads the Interactive Robotics Group of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Shah received her SB (2004) and SM (2006) from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT, and her PhD (2010) in Autonomous Systems from MIT. Before joining the faculty, she worked at Boeing Research and Technology on robotics applications for aerospace manufacturing. She has developed innovative methods for enabling fluid human-robot teamwork in time-critical, safety-critical domains, ranging from manufacturing to surgery to space exploration. Her group draws on expertise in artificial intelligence, human factors, and systems engineering to develop interactive robots that emulate the qualities of effective human team members to improve the efficiency of human-robot teamwork. In 2014, Shah was recognized with an NSF CAREER award for her work on “Human-aware Autonomy for Team-oriented Environments," and by the MIT Technology Review TR35 list as one of the world’s top innovators under the age of 35. Her work on industrial human-robot collaboration was also recognized by the Technology Review as one of the 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2013, and she has received international recognition in the form of best paper awards and nominations from the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, the International Symposium on Robotics, and the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

    <font size=3><b>Talk Title:</b>  Moral Psychology in HRI <br>
    <b>Abstract:</b>  Human society comprises a complex social system encompassing various types of relationships across nested social hierarchies, all structured by rights, rules, and obligations. Robots performing social roles meet the challenge to successfully function in these social systems. In my talk, I will present results of two studies focusing on social norm violation, blame assignment, trust assessment, and social response. These results reveal our expectations of robots regarding human social norms and offer some suggestions for how robots could deal with these expectations. <br>
    <font size=2>Maartje de Graaf is a communication scientist in the multidisciplinary field of human-robot interaction. Her research is driven by her intrinsic motivation to understand human behavior and its underlying psychological and cognitive processes. Since technologies are increasingly endowed with complex and humanlike interfaces and are becoming technically feasible for real-world applications, everyday living is transformed in unprecedented ways. To deal with this potentially radical transformation, De Graaf’s research gains detailed insights into the scope and limits of people’s humanlike treatment of robots on a social, emotional and cognitive level. This knowledge reveals to what extent we regard robots as social beings, which has profound ethical and societal implications for our interactions with these systems. De Graaf aims to document the social context of robot use, contribute to design considerations and policy recommendations about the future standing of robots in society, and inform developers how to design and practitioners how to integrate socially acceptable robot applications that benefit society. <br>
    Maartje de Graaf is an Assistant Professor of Information and Computing Science at the University of Utrecht. In the past, she has worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Brown University’s Humanity Centered Robotics Initiative with a 2-year Rubicon grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). She has a Bachelor of Business Administration in Communication Management (2005), a Master of Science in Media Communication (2011), and a PhD in Communication Science and Human-Robot Interaction (2015).

    <font size=3><b>Talk Title:</b>  How Trust and Explainability are Related: A Multi-Dimensional Framework <br>
    <font size=2>Bertram F. Malle is Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences at Brown University, where he is also Co-Director of the Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative.  He was trained in psychology, philosophy, and linguistics at the University of Graz, Austria, and received his Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University in 1995.  He received the Society of Experimental Social Psychology Outstanding Dissertation award, a National Science Foundation  CAREER award, and is co-recipient of the 2019 Scientific Impact Award of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. He is past president of the Society of Philosophy and Psychology and a Fellow of the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, the Association of Psychological Science, and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Malle’s research, which has been funded by the NSF, Army, Templeton Foundation, Office of Naval Research, and DARPA, focuses on social cognition (e.g., mental state inferences, behavior explanations), moral psychology (e.g., blame, guilt, norms, trust), and human-robot interaction (e.g., morally competent robots, socially assistive robots). He has distributed his work in over 150 scientific publications and several books.  His lab page is <a href="http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci">here</a>.
